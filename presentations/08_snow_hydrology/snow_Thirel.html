# Reminder of last year

Last year, I introduced rainfall-runoff modelling.

Updated list of hydrological modelling packages in &lt;img src="./img_thirel/logo_R.svg" height="25"&gt;

- **airGR**
- **airGRteaching**
- **dynatopmodel**
- **Ecohydmod**
- **fuse**
- **hydromad** (not on CRAN)
- **sacsmaR** (not on CRAN)
- **topmodel**
- **TUWmodel**
- **WALRUS** (not on CRAN)
- etc.

# Example of a rainfall-runoff model

&lt;div class="column-left" style="width:300px"&gt;
Strictly speaking, rainfall-runoff 
models transform rainfall inputs 
into discharge (runoff). 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;GR4J -&gt;

# Let it snow...

&lt;div class="column-left""&gt;
Snowfall happens when temperatures are close to 0&amp;nbsp;°C or lower. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Snow is stored in the &lt;b&gt;snowpack&lt;/b&gt;, to be released days to months later when temperature rise above 0&amp;nbsp;°C for a substancial period of time. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This creates a &lt;b&gt;shift between precipitation&lt;/b&gt; (rainfall + snowfall) &lt;b&gt;and discharge&lt;/b&gt;. 
&lt;/div&gt;

Modelling the snow accumulation and melt improves a lot the simulations.

# Principles of snow models/modules

### Step 1: Accumulation

Snowpack = Snowpack + Snowfall

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Depending on temperature, precipitation is either considered as rainfall or snowfall (or a mix of both).

Frequently we find the following:
- Snowfall if T &lt; 0 °C and rainfall if T &gt;= 0 °C

or

- Snowfall if T &lt; -1 °C, rainfall if T &gt; +3 °C, a linear mix of both in between
---

# Principles of snow models/modules

### Step 2: Melting

Snowpack = Snowpack - Snow melt

#### Degree-day models

- Very common for catchment hydrology
- Simplest option
- Require only P and T

Principle: the rate at which snow melts is governed by the temperature above a threshold (e.g. 0 °C) and a parameter (expressed in mm/°C/day).

#### Energy-balance models

- Quite common for catchment hydrology
- More complex
- Require several variables sometimes difficult to obtain, such as wind speed, radiation, air humidity... 

---

# Snow models in R packages

Not all hydrological modelling R packages contain a snow component. 

We could identify:

- CemaNeige in **airGR** and **airGRteaching**
- SNOW17 in **sacsmaR**
- a module in **SWATmodel**
- a module in **TUWmodel**
- a module in **WALRUS**
- etc.

# The CemaNeige example in airGR

&lt;div class="column-left""&gt;
CemaNeige is a degree-day model.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

It was conceived on the principle of having a model "as simple as possible but not simpler"... &lt;/div&gt;

# How to extrapolate lumped input in airGR


Initially, we have lumped input:

```r
head(BasinObs, n = 2)
```

```
##       DatesR   P    T   E       Qmm
## 1 1999-01-01 0.2 -3.9 0.1 0.6422962
## 2 1999-01-02 4.0 -3.3 0.1 0.6418041
```
Let's extrapolate data (we often do that on 5 elevation bands):

```r
## preparation of the InputsModel object
BasinObs &lt;- BasinObs2
InputsModel &lt;- 
  CreateInputsModel(FUN_MOD = RunModel_CemaNeigeGR4J, 
                    DatesR = BasinObs$DatesR, 
                    Precip = BasinObs$P, 
                    PotEvap = BasinObs$E, 
                    TempMean = BasinObs$T, 
                    ZInputs = median(BasinInfo$HypsoData),
                    HypsoData = BasinInfo$HypsoData, 
                    NLayers = 5)
```

# A step forward: using (satellite) snow data

Most of the time, snow modules are calibrated together with rainfall-runoff models with discharge data only. 

Using snow data in addition to discharge can better constrain the model and therefore improve the simulations.


### Packages to retrieve MODIS sensor SCA data

- **MODIS**: Acquisition and Processing of MODIS Products
- **MODISSnow**: Provides a Function to Download MODIS Snow Cover

### Other snow data sources

- **snotelr**: Calculate and Visualize 'SNOTEL' Snow Data and Seasonality

# Calibrating CemaNeige with MODIS SCA


Initially, we have lumped input:

```r
head(BasinObs, n = 2)
```

```
##       DatesR P     T E   Qls   Qmm  SCA1  SCA2  SCA3  SCA4  SCA5

```



Here we define the optimisation criterion: 


```r
## criterion: 75 % KGE'(Q) + 5 % KGE'(SCA) on each of the 5 layers
inCrit &lt;- 
  CreateInputsCrit(FUN_CRIT = rep("ErrorCrit_KGE2", 6),

# Calibrating CemaNeige with MODIS SCA

Validation over 277 basins: SCA is much better and Q is similar. 

We could show a better transferability of the model.

# Final words

We saw how to model snow-dominated basins in R with **airGR**. 

Several snow modules are available in R. 

Several snow datasets can be retrieved with dedicated packages.
