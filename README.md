- **What?** This session is aimed at hydrologists who are interested in hearing more about R as well as those who are advanced R programmers wanting to discuss recent developments in an open environment. 
- The session is organised in cooperation with the [Young Hydrologic Society (YHS)](https://younghs.com/ "Young Hydrologic Society website") .
- Participants are invited to post and discuss questions in the [Hydrology in R Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1130214777123909/ "link to Hydro-R Facebook group")

## Topics:
The detailed and time-tabled list of contributions, tutorials and discussion points will be here as soon it's ready.

## Slides
All materials will be uploaded to this repository well before the course begins. To get everything (slides, data, code, etc.) onto your local machine, we recommend to [download the whole github course repository](https://codeload.github.com/hydrosoc/rhydro_EGU19/zip/master). Individual presentations (*.html* or PDF files) can be downloaded from the presentation [folder](./presentations) and viewed in a regular web browser.

## Checks
We will provide any relevant information you require to follow along during the course in due time. This includes software (versions) and any other materials. Stay tuned!
